							<p>Transistors act as vital components of all modern electronics. They act as voltage-controlled switches that determine the flow of current through analog and digital circuits. In digital circuits, modern metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors are made from silicon and come in two varieties: n-type or NMOS, where the current is carried by electrons, and p-type or PMOS, where the current is carried by positively charged absent electrons known as holes. When NMOS and PMOS transistors are combined into a complementary system known as CMOS, the resulting circuits can perform logic function without excess power dissipation in standby mode. As a result, CMOS circuits dominate modern digital technology.</p>
							<p>Display technology requires a different type of transistor, known as a thin film transistor (TFT). These TFTs can be deposited on arbitrary substrates, like glass. In the past, TFTs were made from amorphous silicon, which has a low electron mobility of less than 1 cm2/V.s, which makes them relatively inefficient.  Modern TFTs are made from various metal oxides, like indium-zinc-oxide or indium-gallium-zinc-oxide. These materials provide n-type transistors with higher electron mobility of up ~10 cm2/V.s.  However, p-type TFTs have never been created at a commercially viable scale. Copper oxide has been widely researched as a material for this purpose, however, recent studies show that copper iodide (CuI) may be a more promising candidate material for this application. Further it has been proposed that the addition of tin may keep the CuI film amorphous, resulting in even higher electron mobility. If a successful p-type CuI-based TFT can be demonstrated, there is hope of combining it with a zinc-oxide n-type TFT to produce a complementary TFT system. </p>
							<p> I have worked with Professor David Paine and Professor Alexander Zaslavsky at Brown university on this project. This Project carried out with support from the Neal B. Mitchell '58 award and was focused on the fabrication and characterization of CuI and CuSnI thin films for use in p-type TFTs.</p>
							<p>The primary goal of this project was to develop a consistent methodology for the fabrication of CuI thin films. This was achieved through the use of a sputter deposition system to form a layer of Cu on a glass or SiO2 substrate, and then annealing the material in iodine. The properties of the samples were measured using ellipsometry, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and the Van der Pauw method.</p>
							<p>Copper iodide (CuI) and copper tin iodide (CuSnI) were successfully created by sputtering metal layers from 99.99% purity Cu and Cu<sub>0.9</sub>Sn<sub>0.1</sub> targets in a 99.999% Ar gas atmosphere, followed by exposure to iodine vapor at 35 C for 60 minutes.  Below are the SEM pictures of the CuI and CuSnI sample films that were produced, both in cross-section and plan view.</p>

							<p>Plan-view SEM of the same CuI film as in the image above. The material is polycrystalline with grains less than 200 nm in diameter.</p>

							<p>Plan view SEM of CuSnI film.  Compared to CuI layer in Fig. 5 the material is polycrystalline with larger grains, more than 200 nm in diameter. </p>
